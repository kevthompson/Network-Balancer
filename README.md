It is a project that simulates a small group of people and their relations


TO-DO:

-Make FaceList a List<List<double[]>> and use inner products to get values.

-Make a List<double[]> called "NodeVectors"

-FaceList should get vals from NodeVectors and perform operations on each of the vectors, sending the dot products of vectors into the Adjacency Matrix
